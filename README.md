## Getting Started

### Testing

Keep the following in mind when running the tests:

1. You must run the development server before running your tests. It must be open while your tests are running.

1. To get the tests to pass, your components must be named with the same name as the file. If you are struggling to get the tests to pass, reach out to a classmate or an instructor.

## Instructions

Recreate the image below using React and CSS. Use CSS Grid Layout to arrange the four sections of the page.
